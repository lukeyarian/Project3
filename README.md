This app is meant to help kids practice arithmetic. They can choose between difficulty levels, and areas of mathematics like addition, subtraction, etc. The app flows through multiple different screens and carries data from activity to activity.

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* Difficulty levels selection

## Video Walkthrough

## Notes

One of the main challenges I faced was the inital learning on how to transfer data from screen to screen as the app flows. I learned about "Intent" which basically does exactly what I wanted it to do and passes the information from activity to activity.
